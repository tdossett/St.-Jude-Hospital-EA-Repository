    documentation="Security Architecture is a comprehensive structure of organizational, conceptual, logical, and physical components that work together to manage risk across the enterprise. It ensures secure, safe, resilient, reliable, and privacy-respecting behavior throughout the organization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not isolated, but integrated with all other architecture elements, forming a cohesive part of the overall enterprise architecture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Key Elements:&#xD;&#xA;Risk Management: Focuses on both business risk and operational risk, aiming to minimize negative consequences and maximize opportunities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Business-Driven Approach: Business objectives drive the context for risk assessment and dictate the need for security controls and compliance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Systems Engineering Integration: Security is embedded early in the system development lifecycle, with relevant activities in every phase—from early guidance to final security checks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Operational Monitoring: In the operational phase, security is continuously monitored, assessed, and reported, particularly addressed in TOGAF ADM Phases G and H.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Enterprise-Level Focus:&#xD;&#xA;The term “Enterprise Security Architecture” implies alignment with enterprise-wide business goals, rather than local or isolated areas.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The TOGAF definition of “enterprise” spans a broad scope—from departments to entire corporations or government agencies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Security Architecture Outputs:&#xD;&#xA;Relationships across architecture layers are defined to provide traceability and justification for security decisions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Developed using Information Security Management (ISM) and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) practices.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Delivered in coordination with key business and technical stakeholders."/>
